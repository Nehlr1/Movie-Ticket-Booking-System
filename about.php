      <h3>State of the art design</h3>
      <p>Total view seating – an unobstructed view is the ideal. A stepped (stadium) seating arrangement is preferred to a sloping (raked) auditorium. High quality seating – seat design has undergone extensive changes in recent years and may feature: high backs, non-tipping squabs (hinges), adjustable armrests, double or ‘love’ seats, generous leg room, multi-sensory seats (seats that vibrate and move to the action on the screen), and a side table or holder for drinks.</p>
